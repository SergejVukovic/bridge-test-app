# Laravel Post and Comment Management Application

This is a simple Laravel application that allows users to manage accounts, posts, comments, and tags. It supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- User account management: Users can register, login, update their profile, and delete their account.
- Post management: Users can create, view, update, and delete posts.
- Comment management: Users can add, view, update, and delete comments on posts.
- Tag management: Users can add, view, update, and delete tags on posts.

## Setup

This application uses Laravel Sail for easy setup. Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker environment.

To get started, you may follow the [Laravel Sail installation guide](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail#installation).

## Usage

Once you have the application set up, you can start the Laravel Sail development environment using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
